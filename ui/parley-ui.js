 *   search(text)           optional: resolves with what the host's search()
 *                          gives: the whole thread searched, however little
 *                          of it is shown; a message found further back is

 *   open(file)             optional: opens a file the agent showed or cited
 *                          (`file` is { path, open }: `open` is the
 *                          application's own reference, null when it cannot
 *                          be opened)

 *   back                   what Back does to what Parley opens over the

 *                          reactions, the search, the menu of settings):
 *                          true (the default): each one opened takes a step
 *                          of the page's history, and Back closes the one on
 *                          top; closed by its own button or Escape, its step
 *                          is taken back. false: the history is not touched.

 *                          (close() closes it), closed() when it closed by
 *                          itself
 *   locale                 optional: how times and days are written (the
 *                          device's own way when not given)
 *   agentName              optional: the agent's name, said above its messages
 *                          (default: the neutral word of the dictionary)
 *   agentTool              optional: which tool it is, said small beside its
 *                          name in the detailed view
 *   react(to, reaction)    optional: puts a reaction of the set on a message
 *                          of the agent (null: takes it back); `reactions`
 *                          replaces the set, [{ id, icon }] (REACTIONS)
 *   (data.about)           optional, given with the data: [{ label, text,
 *                          tone }], its machine, on the side of the detailed
 *                          view
 *
 * WHAT THE AGENT WRITES, RENDERED (`markdown: true`; without it, plain text).
 * Its Markdown is read into plain data (markdown(), below), then the page is
 * built from that data node by node: never a string of markup, from the
 * agent or from anywhere. Headings, lists, tasks, emphasis, ==highlight==,
 * tables (wide ones scroll in their message), quotes, the alerts of GitHub
 * (> [!IMPORTANT] ... as coloured boxes), badges ([ok] [todo] [blocked]
 * [warn]), code blocks with a Copy button. A link opens only when it is
 * http or https (in a new tab, sending nothing of this page), or a path the
 * application can open (`open`); any other is its text. A picture is shown
 * only from a path the application can open (`picture`): never from
 * anywhere else, since loading it would tell that place who reads. Slots of
 * the application, each optional:
 *   picture(file)          the address of a picture the person may see
 *                          (`file` as for open), or null; pictures the agent
 *                          showed, cited, or the person attached are shown
 *                          in the thread, a click opens them large, to zoom
 *   diagram(code)          resolves with the SVG text of a ```mermaid block,
 *                          drawn by the application's own renderer; it is
 *                          shown as a picture (an <img>: a picture runs
 *                          nothing and loads nothing); no slot, or a
 *                          failure: the block is shown as code
 *   highlight(code, lang)  resolves with a token tree (strings, and
 *                          { type, alias, content } as Prism.tokenize
 *                          gives) to colour a code block; spans are made
 *                          here from it, never its markup
 *   math                   { url, css }: another copy of KaTeX for formulas
 *                          ($...$, $$...$$, \(...\), \[...\]); default:
 *                          Parley's own, ui/vendor/katex/, loaded on the first
 *                          formula; false: formulas shown as written
 *   refs                   { label(ref), open(ref) }: a person of a ```family
 *                          or a zone of a ```picture may carry a ref, as the
 *                          agent wrote it ([Anna](app:people/12)); label names
 *                          the button of its card (null: none), open opens it.
 *                          Parley reads nothing in a ref.
 *
 * A PANEL BESIDE THE THREAD (`side`), optional: a list the application
 * keeps -- its tasks, its batches -- shown on the right of the thread, never
 * over it. Parley knows nothing of where the list comes from:
 *   side                   { title, items, tick(id, on), open(id), folded,
 *                          onFold(folded), count, action: { label, run } }
 *                          items: [{ id, title, text, state, done, checked, owner,
 *                          tone ('active' | 'attention'), tick: false }];
 *                          `text`: what it is, for a person, under its title (two lines shown);
 *                          those not done first, as given; those done
 *                          folded under "Done (n)". What is set is said (a
 *                          state, an owner), what is empty is not. `tick`
 *                          gives each item not done a box to tick (its
 *                          promise refused: said in one line, the box as it
 *                          was); `open`, a click on its title. `count`: the
 *                          number on the bar's button (default: those not
 *                          done; 0: none). `action`: one button under the
 *                          list ("Start the list"). Given again with
 *                          `handle.side = {...}` (null: no panel).
 *                          Wide (PANEL_PX and more): beside the thread,
 *                          folded and unfolded from the bar; `folded` is
 *                          its first state, the person's choice is told to
 *                          onFold for the application to keep (per
 *                          conversation, say), and `handle.folded = v`
 *                          sets it. Narrow: a sheet over the thread, opened
 *                          from the bar, closed by Back, Escape or a tap
 *                          elsewhere.
 *
 * TWO VERSIONS OF A MESSAGE. An agent may give a long message a short one
 * (`short`: a title of one or two lines). The simple view shows the short
 * one, and "See the details" unfolds the rest (kept unfolded for that
 * message); a long message without one is folded after about twelve lines.
 * Either way its > [!IMPORTANT] boxes stay in sight. A question is never
 * folded. The detailed view unfolds everything.
 *
 * SLOTS THE APPLICATION FILLS, each optional; without them, none is shown:
 *   voice                  { listen(on) }: dictation. listen opens the
 *                          microphone and resolves with a function that
 *                          closes it; it calls on.phrase(text) for each
 *                          phrase understood, on.state(word) with
 *                          calibrating, listening, hearing or transcribing,
 *                          on.speech() when speech begins, on.error(message).
 *                          A button beside Send; what is said goes into the
 *                          box. Changed later with `handle.voice = ...`.
 *                          Dictating moves nothing on the screen: what the
 *                          microphone does is said inside the box (its
 *                          placeholder, and a small label on its frame that
 *                          takes no room), never on a line of its own.
 *   autoSend, onAutoSend   "send when I stop": what was said is sent once the
 *                          person stops talking. A choice of the device, not
 *                          of the moment: it is in the small menu of settings
 *                          beside the view, shown only with `voice`, and the
 *                          microphone wears a dot while it is on. The
 *                          person's choice is told to onAutoSend(on), for the
 *                          application to keep.
 *   replies                [{ label, text, send }]: ready answers, above the
 *                          box, after the choices of the question the agent
 *                          asks now. `send: true` sends the text at once,
 *                          otherwise it is put in the box to be completed.
 *                          Changed later with `handle.replies = [...]`.
 *   enter                  'auto' (default: Enter sends where there is a fine
 *                          pointer, a new line on a touch screen), 'send' or
 *                          'newline'. Shift+Enter is always a new line, and
 *                          Ctrl+Enter always sends.
 *   attach                 { upload(file, name) }: files the person attaches
 *                          to a message: picked with a button beside the
 *                          box, pasted into it, or dropped on the chat. Each
 *                          is shown above the box until it is sent (a
 *                          picture as a picture), and on Send each is given
 *                          to upload (a File), which resolves with
 *                          { path, name, size }: where the agent will find
 *                          it. Then the message goes, with them. A message
 *                          may be files alone.
 *   act(id, line)          a button of a line of the application was pressed
 *   touch                  true on a touch screen (default: any coarse
 *                          pointer). The box is then never focused by the
 *                          page, only by the person's finger, so that the
 *                          keyboard never comes up by itself; and a tap on a
 *                          button of the box leaves it open.
 *
 * WHILE IT WORKS, WHAT IT DOES NOW. The agent says in one line what it is
 * doing (`parley doing`); the newest line is shown at the end of the thread,
 * moving, until ITS next message comes (a message of the person does not
 * take it away): then it goes, and the steps that led there are one click
 * away: on that message in the simple view, unfolded above it in the
 * detailed one. When it waits for the person, that is said once, at the end
 * of the thread, until the person writes: a state is not a step.
 *
 * EACH MESSAGE OF THE PERSON says where it is, by a small sign in its corner
 * (its words on hover): sent, not read yet; read; being worked on; handled
 * (the agent answered after reading it, or said it was done). The simple
 * view signs only what is not handled yet; the detailed one signs all.
 *
 * TIMES, as a chat shows them: the day when it changes, the time when long
 * passed between two messages, and the time of each message on hover (a long
 * press on a touch screen).
 *
 * TWO VIEWS OF ONE EXCHANGE. Simple: the agent's messages across a reading
 * column, the person's in bubbles on the right, the one line of what it does
 * now, the choices to answer with, the files that can be opened, times on
 * hover, steps folded into the message they led to (a click on it opens
 * them) -- nothing the person cannot act on. Detailed: every step unfolded
 * between the messages with its time and state, the time of every message,
 * where the agent says it is, every file it showed with its path (one that
 * cannot be opened is said so), and a way to its terminal.
 *
 * LINES OF THE APPLICATION. What happens around the agent (its machine short
 * of memory, restarted, its work sent somewhere) is said in the thread where
 * it happened, as a grey line across with its time and the application's
 * buttons, not as a bubble of either side. The application keeps them, gives
 * them with the messages, and gives each a neutral LEVEL; nothing else is
 * decided here: 'needs-you' is shown in both views; 'news' in both, as a
 * compact line in the simple one where a run of lines of one `topic` is one
 * line ("Sent (3): dev, preprod, dev", each `brief`); 'trace' in the
 * detailed view only. ('warn' and 'bad' read as needs-you, 'info' as news.)
 *
 * EVERYTHING AN AGENT WROTE, AND EVERY WORD OF THE DICTIONARY, IS PUT ON THE
 * PAGE AS TEXT, never as markup: the first is chosen by a program, the
 * second by whoever wrote the dictionary.
